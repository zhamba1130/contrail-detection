# Google Research - Identify Contrails to Reduce Global Warming
  Train ML models to identify contrails in satellite images and help prevent their formation

## 1  Problem Description 
  Contrails are clouds of ice crystals that form in aircraft engine exhaust. They can contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Researchers have developed models to predict when contrails will form and how much warming they will cause. However, they need to validate these models with satellite imagery.
This goal of this competition is to help researchers improve the accuracy of their contrail models. This will help airlines avoid creating contrails and reduce their impact on climate change.
